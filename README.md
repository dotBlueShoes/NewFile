# NewFile 
It's a small windows application that is meant to be run from within the RIGHT-CLICK-CONTEXT-MENU.

This is an old project of mine from around 2018-2019. My educational goal was to create a dialog-only application.

During this process I wanted to learn more about WinAPI subclasses, resources & manifest files. 

> *Weirdly I use this app almost everyday to create files on the fly.*

I run this application from within RIGHT-CLICK-CONTEXT-MENU property I've created years ago.

Eventually i will be placing a tutorial or an app that does exactly that here but for now I simply recomend searching and editing it by yourself. 

It basically involves creating a few properties in the Windows registry.

I recommend the use of **arrow-keys** and **enter-key** *(when done)* when in dialog popup.

Writing in `Extension Name` field is not necessary. For Example if you want to create a file named `.gitignore` you'll type all that in `File Name` property
